OVERVIEW

This report analyzes individual medical costs to understand how demographic and lifestyle factors — such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region — influence healthcare expenses. The dataset provides valuable insights for insurance pricing, public health strategies, and preventive care initiatives.



 KEY STAKEHOLDERS

* Company Stakeholders – Interested in optimizing healthcare-related policies and reducing medical expenditure
* Managers and Directors – Responsible for designing insurance pricing models and wellness programs based on emerging data trends


 INDUSTRY SUCCESS METRICS

* Accurate risk assessment – Aligning premiums with individual health risks
* Preventive healthcare promotion – Reducing high-cost claims via proactive wellness initiatives
* Regional health strategy alignment – Addressing region-specific health issues (e.g., obesity, smoking)
* Fair pricing models – Setting adaptable premiums based on behavior and demographics
* Policy efficiency and equity – Balancing affordability with comprehensive coverage



 KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

 Smokers Have Higher Medical Costs

Smokers, though fewer in number, generate nearly equal total costs as non-smokers.
Recommendation: Launch smoking cessation programs and introduce risk-adjusted premium structures.

 Southeast Region Has the Highest Costs

The Southeast leads in total healthcare expenditure.
Recommendation: Prioritize wellness and lifestyle-focused programs in the Southeast region.

 BMI and Medical Costs

Individuals with a BMI of 25.96 - 35.96 account for the highest expenses.
Recommendation: Implement targeted weight management initiatives and offer lifestyle-based premium discounts.

Medical Costs Peak in Middle Age

The 48–57 age group shows the highest medical expenses, followed by 38–47.
**Recommendation: Promote preventive screenings and chronic disease management for individuals in this age range.

 Gender Differences in Costs

Males incur slightly higher total medical costs than females.
Recommendation: Develop male-focused health awareness and preventive strategies.

Childless Individuals Have Higher Costs

Those with 0 or 1 child tend to have higher medical expenses.
**Recommendation:** Investigate lifestyle or health patterns among childless individuals to identify potential risks.



 POST-ANALYSIS INSIGHTS

* BMI range of 25.96–35.96 consistently leads to high medical costs across all regions
* Most smokers fall within the 18–28 age group, signaling a need for early intervention
* Nonsmokers are the majority, but high BMI and age still contribute heavily to expenses
* The 48–57 age group continues to incur the highest healthcare costs
* Age 0 children show high medical costs likely due to childbirth and neonatal care
* Males dominate costs in the Northeast, Southeast, and Southwest; females in the Northwest



 POST-ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS

* Launch smoking cessation programs for the 18–28 demographic
* Develop region-specific obesity and wellness campaigns
* Tailor healthcare strategies based on gender and regional trends
* Review and improve maternal and neonatal care policies
* Expand preventive care programs for middle-aged adults (48–57)



 CONCLUSION

This analysis reveals that smoking, BMI, age, and geographic region are key drivers of healthcare costs. Addressing these factors with tailored health initiatives and smarter insurance strategies will improve outcomes and control medical expenditures.
